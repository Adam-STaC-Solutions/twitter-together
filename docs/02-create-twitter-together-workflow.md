In the filename input above the code area, replace `main.yml` with `twitter-together.yml`. Then replace the code below with the content of [this repository's `.github/workflows/twitter-together.yml` file](.github/workflows/twitter-together.yml). Make sure to replace `'master'` if you changed your repository's default branch.
